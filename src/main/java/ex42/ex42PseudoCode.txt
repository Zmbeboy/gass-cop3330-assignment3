This program will read in an input file,
Parse the comma seperated values,
And print the result back out formatted as a table

In the Employee class
{
    Employees will have a FirstName
    Employees will have a LastName
    Employees will have a Salary

    Employees can use the printEmployees() function
    {
        prints the last name, first name, and salary in a table format
    }
}

In the App Class
{
    function parseData(String of data)
    {
        Create a new employee
        Create an empty temporary string
        Create an integer equal to zero

        For the length of the inputted string
            If the character at the number of iterations index is not a comma
                Add it to the empty temporary string
            If the character is a comma
                Do one of two things
                {
                    If this is the first time a comma is found
                        Add the temporary string to the LastName value in the employee
                        Reset the temporary string
                        Increase the integer to 1 so the function knows it is not the first time a comma is seen
                    If this is the second time a comma is found
                         Add the temporary string to the FirstName value in the employee
                         Reset the temporary string
                }
        When the length of the string is read the only remaining values in temp will be the salary of the employee
        Set the employees salary to the Interger parse of the temp string
        Return the employee
    end
    }

    function readFile(File)
    {
        Create an empty list of Strings
        Create a Scanner that reads the file

        While there is a next line to be scanned
            Add the next line into the list of strings

        Return the list of strings
    end
    }

    In main
    {
        Create a new File that has the location of the input file
        Create an empty List of Strings
        Create an empty List of Employees

        In a try catch loop
            Set the empty String List equal to the readFile function with the input file as its parameter
            Catch the file not found exception

        For the amount of strings in the String List
            Use the parseData function with the each individual string as a parameter to fill up the Employees list

        Print out some formatting for the table
        For the amount of employees
            call each employees printEmployees function
    }
}
