This program reads in an in input file
Converts all instances of the word utilize to use
Prompts the user for the name of the output file
And generates that output file

function readFile(File)
{
    Creates an empty string
    Creates a scanner that reads the File

    While there is still lines to be read in the file
        Add the next line into the empty string
        If there is a next line after the string is added
            Add a newline character to the string

    Return the string
end
}

function replaceWord(A String with the words that need to be replaced, a String of the word that needs to be replaced, a String of the word that will replace it)
{
    Use the .replaceAll function of the String class with the input string and the find and replace words as parameters
    Return the replaced string
end
}

function createFile(String of the file path, String of what needs to be outputted)
{
    Create a file with the file path
    Set the PrintStream to the new file instead of the console
    And print the output to the file
end
}

In Main
{
    Create a scanner for user input
    Create a String for the root of the file
    Create a new file to hold the input
    And make two empty strings for the input and output

    In a try catch loop
        Set the input String equal to the realFile function with the input file as the parameter
        Catch a fileNotFoundException
    Set the output String equal to the replaceWord function with the input string, "utilize", and "use" as its parameters
    Ask the user what they want the output file to be called
    Add that user response to the file root and pass that along with the output string to createFile
