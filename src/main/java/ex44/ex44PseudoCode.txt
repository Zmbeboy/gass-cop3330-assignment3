This program will read input in from a json file
Store the input as products in a list
And uses the list as a database that the user can read information from

In the Product class
{
    A String name variable
    A Double price variable
    A integer quantity variable

    Each of these variables has both a set and get function
}

In the Data Class
{
    Stores a list of Products
    The list has its own set and get functions
}

In the App Class
{
    function objectFound(String containing the search term, and a Data Object)
    {
        For the amount of products in the Data objects List of products
            If the name of the the product is equal to the search term
                Output the Products information
                Return True
        The outside of the for loop will only run if no Products match the search term
        Print that the object was not found
        Return false
    end
    }

    In main
    {
        Create a scanner to read user input
        Create a Gson object
        Create an empty object

        In a try catch loop
            Create a JsonParser
            Set the empty object equal to the JsonParsers.parse function of the input file
            Typecast the object to a JsonObject
            Use the .fromJson function from the Gson object to store the information in a Data object
            The Data object's Product list will get filled out during this step

            Create a boolean equal to false
            While this boolean is false
                Prompt for user input
                Use the objectFound function to check if the user input is within the Data object
                Set the boolean equal to the objectFound functions return value
            Then use a catch to check for any IOexceptions
    }
