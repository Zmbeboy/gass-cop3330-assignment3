This function reads an input file
Stores the words in the file along with how many of each
Sort them based on frequency fo each word
And format them into a table

In the Word class
{
    A String that holds the word
    An Integer that holds the quantity of the words

    Both variables have their own get and set functions
}

In the App Class
{
    function readFile(File)
    {
        Creates an empty string
        Creates a scanner that reads the File

        While there is still lines to be read in the file
            Add the next line into the empty string
            Add a space after each line

        Return the string
    end
    }

    function printWords(A list of word objects)
    {
        For the amount of word objects
            Print out the word
            For the quantity of that word
                Print an asterisk representing the word
            Print a newline
    end
    }

    function wordSort(A list of unsorted word objects)
    {
        Create a list of word objects
        Create two integers representing the index of the highest quantity and the highest quantity

        While there is words in the unsorted word list
            For each word in the unsorted word list
                If its the first word checked
                    Set the highest index and quantity to this word objects values
                Else if the quantity of the word is higher than the highest quantity so far
                    Set the new highest index and quantity to the new Words values
            Add the highest quantity word to the new array
            And remove it from the old array
            Repeat until every word is added into the new array in the correct order
        Return the sorted word array
    end
    }

    function wordParse(An array of strings each containing a single word)
    {
        Create a List of word objects
        Create a boolean representing if the current word is in the List yet

        For the amount of Strings in the array
            Set the boolean to false
            For each word inside the list of word objects
                If the String is equal to the word value of the Word
                    Set the boolean to true
                    And increase the quantity of that word object
            If the word is not found in the List of Words
                Create a new word
                Set the Words word to the input string
                And the quantity to 1
                Add that word to the List of Words
        Return the List of words
    end
    }

    In main
    {
        Create a scanner to get user input
        Create a file at the input files location
        Create an empty input string

        In a try catch loop
            Set the empty string to the readFile function with file as its parameter
            Catch a file not found exception

        Create a List of Word objects
        Set that list equal to the wordParse function with the input string split into an array at each space
        Pass that list into the wordSort function

        And pass the list into the printWords function to see the result
